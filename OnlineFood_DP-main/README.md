This is a small project for Design Pattern (DP) 
Task :
Use Strategy, Factory and Decorator Pattern for a particular scenario.

2. Define your own way of taking user choice.
3. Implement that.
4. Draw the UML diagram.
5. Submit through a report.

My solution:
An online food ordering system is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate the seamless process of placing
orders for a diverse range of dishes from various cuisines. This system caters to different culinary preferences,
